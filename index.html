<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>I moved to the gold cost 5 years ago for a change of pace. And have worked with Puma for the last 9 years, who were nice enough to help me move and find work up here.</p>
<p>Prior education is nothing special, I dropped out of high school just before the end of year 10 due to bullying, it was never an environment where I could thrive. Twice since then I have attempted to engage in further study however something always got in the way preventing me from completing it. However now it is my primary focus and I am very determined to finish this course in order to help me being a long awaited career change.</p>
<p>Most of my spare time is spent playing video games, mostly single player games. Favourite games pretty much come from three franchises; Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, and The Legend of Zelda.</p>
<p>Once in a blue moon I’ll try out an MMO, but I get way too invested and spend every other moment playing until I get to a point a couple of months later and realise I just need to stop. Most notably with FFXIV, which every couple of years I’ll pick up again.
</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT began at a fairly young age. Playing around with the family computer when I was probably about 9 years old, fascinated by the internet, the amazing graphics of the old 8-bit DOS games, and just exploring though all the systems, settings and files that every computer has.</p>

<h1>Experience in IT</h1>
<p>While I have no formal training in IT, I have taught myself a decent amount (mostly through Google). When I was younger my father collected used computers and I had the time of my life pulling them apart and playing around with the hardware. (I was always better at pulling them apart than I was at putting them back together). At work I’m the one anyone goes to with any IT issues before contacting our actual IT department. As I have been with the company for so long I’ve learned quite a bit about how our systems work and what the most common fixes are. And if I don’t know I’ll generally tinker around until I get it, with a pretty good success rate!</p>

<h1>Why did I choose RMIT?</h1>
<p>Choosing to study with RMIT was a pretty easy decision. While I lived in Melbourne RMIT was already my first choice to study IT as they have an excellent reputation, great reviews and very knowledgeable staff. And even though I live in the gold Coast currently, going through OUA has given me the option once again to go through RMIT.</p>

<h1>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h1>
<p>During my studies I am hoping to learn the fundamentals of IT, creating websites and applications, and anything that will help me assist people and peers remotely.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Openness: Medium</h3>
<p>Trying new things when planned in advance and in the right mood can be a very enjoyable experience. But generally prefer routine in day to day activities.</p>
<h3>Conscientiousness: Medium</h3>
<p>Mood and context are a large factor in how to approach organisation and detail. You can be very organised and focused, but in an unideal situation it can be easy to become overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>Extroversion: Low</h3>
<p>Commonly known as an introvert. Getting energy and feeling most comfortable while alone. Parties or large social gatherings can be very draining and an introvert will generally feel the need to be alone before and/or after to recharge their social battery. Not usually loud or talkative, choosing only to speak up when they have something important to say.</p>
<h3>Agreeableness: High</h3>
<p>Also known as “Yes” people, or people pleasers. Highly agreeable people tend to be very friendly and compassionate. They’re team players who are very empathetic and are good at getting people to collaborate and cooperate. Also good at making people feel comfortable and feel they can open up to you.</p>
<h3>Neuroticism: High</h3>
<p>High neurotics are worriers. Tend to be quite anxious and have greater reactions when things don’t go as planned, and can take quite a while to calm down. They will think through many options before making a decision.</p>
<h2>What do these results mean to me?</h2>
<p>I identify with most of these results, as an introverted, rather sensitive person who can be quite disorganised and down in the dumps. However I am a focused worker who thrives while ‘doing’ things. I get along with most people I meet, and those I choose to get to know tend to become close friends.</p>
<h3>Team Influence</h3>
<p>While working in a team I do tend to be a rather agreeable person, not speaking up unless I have something urgent or important to say. I do however have an easy time getting along with most people.</p>
<h3>Taking this into account when forming a team</h3>
<p>While forming a team I’m going to have to push beyond my comfort zone,  speaking up not only when I consider something to be important or urgent, but go out of my way to make suggestions and engage in conversations.</p>
