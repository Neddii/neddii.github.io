<h2 style="color: #CBF7ED">Personal Information</h2>
<p>I moved to the gold cost 5 years ago for a change of pace. And have worked with Puma for the last 9 years, who were nice enough to help me move and find work up here.</p>
<p>Prior education is nothing special, I dropped out of high school just before the end of year 10 due to bullying, it was never an environment where I could thrive. Twice since then I have attempted to engage in further study however something always got in the way preventing me from completing it. However now it is my primary focus and I am very determined to finish this course in order to help me being a long awaited career change.</p>
<p>Most of my spare time is spent playing video games, mostly single player games. Favourite games pretty much come from three franchises; Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, and The Legend of Zelda.</p>
<p>Once in a blue moon I’ll try out an MMO, but I get way too invested and spend every other moment playing until I get to a point a couple of months later and realise I just need to stop. Most notably with FFXIV, which every couple of years I’ll pick up again.
</p>

<h2 style="color: #CBF7ED">Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT began at a fairly young age. Playing around with the family computer when I was probably about 9 years old, fascinated by the internet, the amazing graphics of the old 8-bit DOS games, and just exploring though all the systems, settings and files that every computer has.</p>

<h2 style="color: #CBF7ED">Experience in IT</h2>
<p>While I have no formal training in IT, I have taught myself a decent amount (mostly through Google). When I was younger my father collected used computers and I had the time of my life pulling them apart and playing around with the hardware. (I was always better at pulling them apart than I was at putting them back together). At work I’m the one anyone goes to with any IT issues before contacting our actual IT department. As I have been with the company for so long I’ve learned quite a bit about how our systems work and what the most common fixes are. And if I don’t know I’ll generally tinker around until I get it, with a pretty good success rate!</p>

<h2 style="color: #CBF7ED">Why did I choose RMIT?</h2>
<p>Choosing to study with RMIT was a pretty easy decision. While I lived in Melbourne RMIT was already my first choice to study IT as they have an excellent reputation, great reviews and very knowledgeable staff. And even though I live in the gold Coast currently, going through OUA has given me the option once again to go through RMIT.</p>

<h2 style="color: #CBF7ED">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h2>
<p>During my studies I am hoping to learn the fundamentals of IT, creating websites and applications, and anything that will help me assist people and peers remotely.</p>

<img src="job_ad.jpg" style="max-width: 400px" alt="Job ad screenshot">
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Job Description</h3>
<p>
A full stack developer is currently my ideal position. Mostly due to the fact that I’m currently unsure of what I want my actual main field of expertise to be, and as a full stack developer will have a decent understanding of many different skillsets.
While this job description is rather vague, it expresses that this will be a no-fuss, general software development position from a remote location.
Working remotely is a large part of the appeal, giving the freedom to work from home or abroad, from bed or at the park. Not being stuck between the same four walls day in/day out.
</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Skills Required</h3>
<p>A good understanding of coding in multiple languages. Such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front end development, Python, C# and Ruby for back end development.
Knowledge of web architecture and database management systems.
Proficiency with Microsoft Azure(cloud services), .Net core(app framework) and Angular 8+(web applications)
Understanding of the fundamentals of design.
Passion for quality.
</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Skills I Have</h3>
<p>A basic understanding of the universal principals of design.
Passion for quality
</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Learning Plan</h3>
<p>First step towards obtaining these skills is completing the Bachelor of IT course at RMIT. Providing the knowledge and skills essential to the IT industry: Web and mobile development, cloud and security computing, data management, software analysis and development. RMIT also provides courses revolving around design principals helping to further any knowledge already possessed in the subject.</p>

<p></p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Openness: Medium</h3>
<p>Trying new things when planned in advance and in the right mood can be a very enjoyable experience. But generally prefer routine in day to day activities.</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Conscientiousness: Medium</h3>
<p>Mood and context are a large factor in how to approach organisation and detail. You can be very organised and focused, but in an unideal situation it can be easy to become overwhelmed.</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Extroversion: Low</h3>
<p>Commonly known as an introvert. Getting energy and feeling most comfortable while alone. Parties or large social gatherings can be very draining and an introvert will generally feel the need to be alone before and/or after to recharge their social battery. Not usually loud or talkative, choosing only to speak up when they have something important to say.</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Agreeableness: High</h3>
<p>Also known as “Yes” people, or people pleasers. Highly agreeable people tend to be very friendly and compassionate. They’re team players who are very empathetic and are good at getting people to collaborate and cooperate. Also good at making people feel comfortable and feel they can open up to you.</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Neuroticism: High</h3>
<p>High neurotics are worriers. Tend to be quite anxious and have greater reactions when things don’t go as planned, and can take quite a while to calm down. They will think through many options before making a decision.</p>
<h2 style="color: #CBF7ED">What do these results mean to me?</h2>
<p>I identify with most of these results, as an introverted, rather sensitive person who can be quite disorganised and down in the dumps. However I am a focused worker who thrives while ‘doing’ things. I get along with most people I meet, and those I choose to get to know tend to become close friends.</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Team Influence</h3>
<p>While working in a team I do tend to be a rather agreeable person, not speaking up unless I have something urgent or important to say. I do however have an easy time getting along with most people.</p>
<h3 style="color: #CBF7ED">Taking this into account when forming a team</h3>
<p>While forming a team I’m going to have to push beyond my comfort zone,  speaking up not only when I consider something to be important or urgent, but go out of my way to make suggestions and engage in conversations.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This cleaning and chore scheduling app will assist users in organising a functional cleaning and chore checklist, with assorted tasks that need to be done with varying frequencies in all areas of the home. This checklist can also be viewed by other members of the household, and each person can have specific tasks or locations assigned to them throughout any given time period in order to help share the load. </p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>As someone who works full time and now studies part time, it is difficult to set up a cleaning structure at home. It’s very easy to just get home and do nothing. Something like this sending reminders out to do specific things every now and then could hopefully be the little push needed to help motivate one to perform cleaning duties throughout the week.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This app will have numerous features in order to help you to keep your house clean.</p>
<p>While setting up this app, you will add in the number of rooms and separate areas in your house, with the ability to give each its own unique name. Additionally, multiple users can download the app and share information via the cloud. Any users can also be added to the same home and have tasks assigned to them. Notifications and reminders will be utilised on the day the task is due to be completed.</p>
<p>There will also be a list of cleaning tasks predefined such as vacuuming, dusting, clean windows, and so on. Each room will have its own list of tasks depending on the room itself, so your bedroom would have “change sheets, wipe down bedside table, clean windows” and depending on the contents of the bedroom, could also have “clean mirror, wipe down fan, etc”.</p>
<p>Each individual task will also have its own suggested frequency which can be altered at will. Changing sheets could be once a week, vacuuming three times a week, mowing the lawns once every two weeks, take the bins out every Wednesday and put on a load of laundry every two days.</p>
<p>Users can be added and assigned tasks to be completed. So, John could vacuum “Johns room” on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. An alterative assignment process would be by task. So once a week, Sally could clean all windows in the home.
There will be multiple ways to view tasks to be done. By timespan will give an overview of everything to be done that day/week/month. By room will give an overview of each room/area and all tasks to be completed within. By user will give an overview of each user and all tasks assigned to them.</p>
<p>Once completed tasks will be checked off until the next time the are due to be completed.
</p>
<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
<p>The only hardware needed for this application is a phone or tablet.  Software needed would be along the lines of Swift and /or Android Studio for app development, and an emulator in order to test. Microsoft Azure or something similar cloud computing services to make data sync between devices. Photoshop, Sketch or Wireframe.cc for creating wireframes and general design for the app.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>Programming language knowledge, such as Python, Java, Swift and/or C++. Decent proficiency using software such as Photoshop, Sketch and Wireframe.cc in order to create the overall layout, graphics and design for the app. Overall the necessary skills should be relatively easy to develop though study, trial and error.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The successful use of this app will help maintain order in a household. Whether you’re living alone and just need reminders of what to clean and how often to clean without trying to get it all done in one hit and getting overwhelmed. Or if you share your house with housemates or family you can distribute tasks fairly throughout the household in order to share the load, being sent updates when communal areas have been cleaned or notifications when a task is coming up to be due, or if it is overdue.</p>
<p>This would be particularly impactful for families with teenagers who can spend a lot of time on their devices. If a task isn’t completed on time this would open opportunities for conversational development, where you can detail how much work has been completed by other members of the household compared to someone who isn’t doing their part.
